					<h2>Spyfall game telegram bot project</h2>
					<p>Spyfall is a board game. It suits for parties of any size. Simple rules are the following: one of 30 locations (cafe, church, schooll etc.) is randomly chosen to be current environment. It is told to everyone, except one person. This person is named "spy". Spy doesn't know current location, but no one knows who is spy. One by one players ask questions to each other. Spy tries to figure out the current location, other players want to find the spy. Once spy has figured out current location, he must expose himself and make his guess. Depending on correctness of his answer, he receives or loses points. On the other hand, once any other player has figured out who is spy, he can impeach another player and earn/lose points. If no declarations were done and one round of questions is finished, all players vote for spy. If players are right, they receive points, otherwise points go to spy. After that the new location and new spy are assigned. More detailed rules of game Spyfall can be found on Internet.</p>
					<p>The idea of messenger bot creation emerged during playing a traditional Spyfall. Traditional version consists of 30 sets of cards. Cards of each set carry name of the same location. Also each set has 1 card only with a word SPY on it. It results in a quite huge stack of cards and rather annoying dealing operations. I understood that the game can be managed by application which randomizes location from list of locations, randomizes spy from list of registered players and sends corresponding information to players via some messenger. Current bot operates on messenger <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>. It is operated by admin user, who switches between registration of players (SETUP) mode and message distribution (GAME) mode. Admin is recognised by app via password. Other users just follow simple instruction in order to register, after that they will only receive messages with locations.</p>
					<p>Name of the bot in Telegram is SpyTeleBot. User starts a dialog by sending "Hello" (here and later: messages must be send without quotation marks). If bot receives something else, he asks to say Hello to him, otherwise he asks if user is admin. Admin answeres "1", then bot asks for the password. If correct password was given, bot announces current mode and number of registered players and asks if admin wants to register new list of players (send "2") or send messages to players of the current list (send "3"). After choise of registration of new list of players (SETUP mode) all other users can send "Hello" to the bot and answer "0" to the question about admin - this will register players in a new list. Each player of a new list will receive a confirmation. When everybody who wants to take part in the game has received a confirmation, admin switches bot to GAME mode which sends corresponding messages to all players. To start a new game with the same players on another location, admin should just send "3". End of the game does not require any specific actions, all the setup procedures are performed in the beginning of the game.
