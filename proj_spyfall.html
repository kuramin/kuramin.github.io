					<h2>Spyfall game telegram bot project</h2>
					<p>Spyfall is a game for parties of any size. Simple rules are the following: one of 30 locations (cafe, church, schooll etc.) is chosen to be current environment. It is told to everyone, except one person. This person is named "spy". Spy doesn't know current location, but no one knows who is spy. One by one players ask questions to each other. Spy tries to figure out the current location, other players want to find the spy. Once somebody has reached the goal, the new location and new spy are assigned.</p>
					<p>This bot operates on messenger <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>. The bot performs registration of players, random choise of location and spy, sends the corresponding messages to players. It is operated by admin user, who switches between SETUP and GAME modes. Other users after registration will just receive messages with locations. Admin user is distinguished by password.</p>
					<p>Detailed description of bot's logic is illustrated by the following picture:</p>
