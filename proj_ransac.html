					<h2>Laser scanning technologies</h2>
					<p>This section describes an application of Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for detection of planes in a point cloud.
					RANSAC is widely used for fitting a model to experimental data. RANSAC uses an approach which is opposite to classical algorithms of parameter estimation. Instead of iterating through derivation of a solution from as much data as possible and elimination of outliers, RANSAC uses the smallest possible dataset to define the model and then computes an amount of data which agree with it. In this case gross errors don't have any influence: the only amount of consistent data plays a role.</p>
					<p>The goal of the current project was detection of planes via RANSAC in a point cloud of 400 000 points which is result of laser scanning of buildings in Charite clinic in Berlin. Algorithm itself, it's application and results are presented in a scientific article which can be downloaded as a pdf-file: </p>

					<p> Code in C++ can be found on <a href="https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/users/kuramin/projects">my GitLab repository</a>. </p>
					<p>Some pictures of results are also shown on the current page. Depending on values of hyper-parameters, the result can be more detailed as it is on the following picture:</p>
